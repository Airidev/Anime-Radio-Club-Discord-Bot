# Bot is being remade!

# Official ANIMERADIO.club Discord Bot
The official Anime Radio Club Discord bot!!! Made with Discord.js
# Usage
After you've added the bot to your server, join a voice channel and type `>join` to bind the bot to that channel. You have to have the "Manage server" permission to use this command.

# Run it with your own custom Bot or something
* Clone the Git or Repo or whatnot
* Create a Discord OAuth application and bot account
* Rename/duplicate `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill out the relevant information
* Install Discord JS using Node JS and the command `npm install discord.js`
* Make sure Discord JS is up to date
* Download [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)
* Take the files from the first folder which should be named "Bin" and put it in the same folder as the Bot
* Install Winston with `npm install winston`
* Install Common-Tags with `npm install common-tags`
* Run the bot with `node animeradioclub.js`

# Troubleshooting
* If you get an error regarding `Opus-Engine` just do `npm install opusscript` and all should be fine.
* If the bot stops playing music, check to see if the website says that there are at least 1 or more listeners and then use `>join`.
* If the bot still does not play any music, try `>leave` and then `>join`.
